# Algorithm Implemetations
Python implementations for algorithms learnt in CZ2001-Algorithms in NTU Singapore.
## Topics contained
* Hash tables 
    1. Closed address hashing
    2. Open address hashing (Linear probing and double hashing)
* Searching - Sequential and binary search
* Sorting - Insertion sort, Mergesort, QuickSort, and HeapSort
* Graphs:
    - DFS, BFS, and Dijkstra's algorithm
    - anytree used (`pip install anytree`) for visualising and implementing trees.
